#### Inharmonic Spectra

- We have started our study of spectra at the simplest types, the ones present in periodic waves.
- These belong to sounds that give us an impression of pitch.
- They also give rise to harmonic spectra, components of partials whose frequency is a whole number multiple of a fundamental frequency (the overtone series)



#### Inharmonic Spectra

- What about all other sounds? The majority of sounds around us will exhibit an inharmonic spectrum, in other words, non-pitched sounds. These sounds are composed of partials that are not aligned with the whole number series. So there is no mathematical relationship between overtones and a fundamental frequency as there is with harmonic spectra.



#### Inharmonic Spectra

- As a result, there will not be a definite sensation of pitch (or you might hear something like a chord, with a number of distinct pitches), as opposed to one "pitched" note.

#### Discrete Inharmonic Spectra

- Certain sounds, such as bells and gongs will exhibit the following characteristics:
- 1) A number of discrete components which will not be harmonically related to each other. The result will be something between a chord and timbral colour.



#### Discrete Inharmonic Spectra

- 2) The loudest partials will be tracked by our ear and out pitch perception in regards to the sound will be focused on them.
- The line between 'chord' and 'timbre/colour' can be very thin: certain sounds can be perceived as timbre in one circumstance and as a chord in another.
- Consider the sound of a bell versus a very full piano chord



#### Spectrogram of Cathedral Bell

- Spectrograph of same bell taken near the beginning of the sound
- As we can see it exhibits 10 clear peaks up to 1100 hz and an 'unresolved' region at around 500-650Hz.




<img src="./images/bell2.jpg"></img>
- In this plot, a clear peak around 140Hz (-4dB and one at around 700Hz (-12dB) stand out from the rest. 
Note:
Negative decibels are relative to the maximum output of the amp rather than threshold of hearing, relative scale

- Here is another spectral 'snapshot' from a later stage in the sound evolution, focusing on the lower end of the spectrum (< 700Hz)



<img src="./images/bell_spectrograph.jpg"></img>

- Note that partial 3 (160Hz) is now almost at the same level as parital 2, partial 3 did not decay as much as partial 2
- We can now see a bit of clarity beginning to evolve around region 7



#### Distributed Spectra

- When sounds have a greater number of partials which cannot be easily resolved, we can talk of distributed spectra.
- These sounds are not likely to exhibit any pitch 'focusing' and will show a more even distribution of energy in spectral bands.
- The best example of a distributed spectra is white noise: it is called white in analogy to colour as it contains (statistically) all frequencies in the spectrum of our hearing.

Note:
Show white noise spectrogram



#### Formants

- The smooth shape obtained by spectral analysis of an audio signal is called the spectral envelope. This shows us the frequency composition of a waveform. 
- Bright sounds will exhibit a spectral envelope that ascends with frequency, whereas low 'rumbling' sounds will exhibit a descending spectral envelope.
- Spectral envelopes also show the phenomenon of formants very clearly. Formants are fixed regions of resonance in the spectrum, which will enhance any partial around that frequency.



#### Formants and Vocal Sounds

- A formant is a concentration of acoustic energy around a particular frequency in a waveform.
- Formants are present in all instrumental sounds, but are especially important for the sound production of the voice.
- The characteristic sound of a formant region results from a system consisting of an excitation source, such as vocal cords or a vibrating reed, and a resonating system,such as the vocal tract or a length of tubing.



#### Formants and Vocal Sounds
- The resonating system causes the amplitudes of the partials occurring in certain frequency regions to be emphasized. This produces formant peaks in those regions which are related to the size, shape and material of the resonating body.
- The shape of the vocal cavaties will generate a number of formants.



#### Formants and Vocal Sounds

- These will be related to the timbre of the voice and to the specific vowel being produced. Different vowels exhibit different formant regions, so they affect the timbre of the voice. Some synthesisers offer formant filters to simulate vowels.



#### Formants and Vocal Sounds
- The vocal formants for the different vowels will vary for each different types of voice. The formant regions are defined by their:
    - Centre frequency: Where the region is centered.
    - Bandwidth: how wide the formant is.
    - Amplitude: the peak amplitude in the bandwidth region

#### Summary

- So, timbre is related to the percieved tone quality of particular sounds.
- Fourier's theorem states that 'any periodic signal can be represented as a weighted sum of integrally related sinusoids called harmonics'
- The frequencies of these sinusoidal components will be integer multiples of the fundamental frequency.



#### Summary

- These components, because of their integer relationship with a fundamental are also called harmonic components or harmonics.
- The different mixture of harmonics, the presence/absence, individual amplitudes etc.. will be the main element affecting the nature of a wave (the shape and timbre)
- This weighted sum is known as the Fourier Series and is more commonly referred to as the spectrum of sound



#### Transients

- Many instrumental sounds exhibit, for a very short period during the attack portion, the phenomena of transients. This tends to be very important for our perception of instrumental timbre.
- Transients are short lived instabilities in the sound waveform, which involve the presence of inharmonic components in the spectrum. These instabilities very quickly settle down and the expected spectrum then appears.



#### Transients

- These instabilities are related to inertial aspects of the vibrating elements in a system, so they are a feature of the start or 'onset' of sounds (inertia, the law of motion that states that things at rest tend to stay at rest unless acted upon by an external force.
- These transients occur in the first 50 to 100 milliseconds of an instrumental sound when its spectrum is very unstable.



#### Transients

- For example, the air column inside a saxophone has a certain amount of inertial resistance that must be overcome before it will vibrate properly. During the onset of a note, that inertial battle produces wild spectral fluctuations called the initial transients. The pitch of the instrument is initially highly unstable before we hear the 'saxophone' sound.



#### Transients

- For stringed instruments, higher pitches are generally produced by shorter lengths of string and thus exhibit less inertial resistance and shorter transients. Low pitches are produced by longer lengths of string (and often thicker strings) and thus exhibit more inertia and longer transients. As the string (or air column) overcomes the inertial resistance, both pitch and spectrum stabilize.
- These variations in initial-transients behaviour provide important cues as to what instrument is making the sound.
Note:
Maybe an example of cues


#### Timbre and Dynamics

- Dynamics = volume in musical terms
- Instrumental timbre is also dependent on the intensity of sound. For instance, the time varying spectrum of an instrument will be different for each dynamic level.



#### Timbre and Dynamics

- This is an important consideration for the synthesis of sound: a piano sound analysed at $ pp $ will exhibit different spectral and timbral qualities than one at $ ff $. So if we re-synthesise a $ pp $ sound at an $ ff $ level, it will not sound realistic. This is considered when synthesising sounds in an electric piano with weighted keys.



#### Timbre and Dynamics

- This is what we call the 'volume control effect': the note will just sound as if the volume was turned up, not like a real $ ff $ sound
- Most Wavetable synthesisers are based on acoustic instrument samples. If the synth does not use multiplier wavetables different samples for different pitches, intensities etc..) the note may appear acoustically and perceptually 'wrong'.




#### Onset Asynchrony

- In many sounds there is an onset asynchrony between the different spectral components. The onset times are not the same, as we have seen.
- In the case of trumpet tones, higher partials 'attack' more slowly - an onset asynchrony in the range of 20 milliseconds (0.02 seconds) is typical.



#### Onset Asynchrony

- Perceptually, if the asynchrony exceeds 30 to 70 msecs, partials will not fuse together as strongly into a single sound.
- This is similar to the effect of chordal synchrony: a small amount of asynchrony does not hinder our perception of a number of notes as a chord (30-50msec). A higher amount would generate arpeggio like effects.



#### Onset Asynchrony

- The presence of a small fluctuation in frequency, added equally to all partials, helps the perception of complex sounds as a fused unity.
- This can take the form of small variations plus a periodic modulation of frequency (the vibrato)
Note:
Look at a spectrum



#### Grey and Gordon 3D Timbre Space
https://at.or.at/hans/misc/timbre-space/timbre-space.html



#### Observations

- Timbre is multi-dimensional and is related to many aspects of a sound. It is not possible to organise timbre on a simple scale of 'less/more' corresponding to one physical attribute of the sound (even the 3D 'timbre space' of Grey and Gordon is a simplification
- Spectral evolution is an important feature of most sounds.
- Pitched sounds will exhibit either a harmonic or nearly harmonic spectrum (many pitched sounds will not have an exact harmonic spectrum)



#### Observations

- Non-pitched sounds will not have a harmonic spectrum. There is a 'grey' area between them (a pitched sound might exhibit some inharmonic partials as well as harmonic ones)
- The onset (attack) period of sounds is a very important aspect in timbre perception: the initial sounds which are associated with driving instrument's systems into action (transients) are often very useful as an instrument's sonic signature.
- The distribution of spectral energy is very important.
