### MU610A: Acoustics & Psychoacoustics
### Edward Costello



### Introduction

- Two subjects: Acoustics, Psychoacoustics
- Importance of Acoustics and Psychoacoustics
Note:
Acoustics: The scientific study of sounds waves,
The characteristics of a room, auditorium that determine how sound is transmitted within it.

Psychoacoustics: The scientific study of sound perception. Branch of science studying the psychological and physiological responses associated with sound (including noise, speech and music)

Why are they important?
Acoustics is important for understanding how sound and vibrations work, capturing and reproducing sound at high fidelity, creating good speakers, microphones, recording equipment, finding or making good rooms for performance and recording, creating instruments, noise cancelling, audio signal processing, also used in medical, ultrasound, dentist etc..

Psychoacoustics important can be also used in audio signal processing, mp3, modern audio formats make use of the psychoacoustic properties to compress audio, for spatialisation of sound using just headphones, creating auditory illusions, composition etc.



#### Assessment

- Continuous assessment: 30%
- End of semester exam: 70%
- Presentations Friday 8th December
Note:
Based on what you've learned in class
Example presentations: Room acoustics in own studio, loudness wars
May be group or individual...



#### Course content

##### Acoustics
- The science of sound, branch of physics
- Various models/basic theories and concepts used to study sound
- Group presentation
Note:
We will also cover
Wave Parameters: the period, the frequency, the amplitude, the wavelength, and the speed

Acoustic Impedance: measures of the opposition that a system presents to the acoustic flow resulting of an acoustic pressure applied to the system

Sound Intensity, Power and Pressure Level, Adding Sounds



#### Course content

##### Psychoacoustics
- Human perception of sound
- Psychoacoustic phenomena, how sound is perceived / processed by our senses, auditory illusions
- Application of knowledge in composition/recording techniques
- The ear / auditory scene analysis / hearing damage
Note:
Pitch perception
Timbre



#### Aside: Auditory Illusion, Shephard / Risset Glissando

#### Resources

##### Books
- Albert S. Bregman, Auditory Scene Analysis (1st and last chapters)
- David M. Howard & James Angus, Acoustics & Psychoacoustics (Many of these notes are from this book, this is a key text)
- Daniel Levitin, This is your Brain on Music, looks at the phenomenon of sound from a cognitive perspective.
- Perry Cook, Music, Cognition and Computerized Sound
Note:
Albert S. Bregman: addresses the problem of hearing complex auditory environments, using a series of creative analogies to describe the process required of the human auditory system as it analyzes mixtures of sounds to recover descriptions of individual sounds

David M. Howard & James Angus: Also easily findable online as a pdf.

Daniel Levitin: Pyschoacoustic focused, describes the components of music, such as timbre, rhythm, pitch, and harmony[4] and ties them to neuroanatomy, neurochemistry, cognitive psychology, and evolution

Perry Cook: on the basic physiology and functions of the ear and auditory sections of the brain, then proceeds to discuss numerous topics associated with the study of psychoacoustics, including cognitive psychology and the physics of sound

#### Attendance
Note:
Class attendance. Highly encouraged to come to every class.
Noted, nobody shown for 3 sessions. Would be nice to know



#### Upcoming Topics / Terms to Clarify

- Sound
- Noise
- Music
- Acoustics
- Psychoacoustics
- Audition
- Auditory Scene Analysis

Note:
Sound: is a vibration which propagates through a medium such as a solid, liquid or gas, as an audible wave of pressure.

Noise: is any sound in the acoustic domain, also types of noise, white noise, pink noise, brown noise, sound energy randomly spread across a particular frequency band

Music: lots of definitions but we will go with patterns of sounds produced by people performing / programming instruments

We had these before...

Acoustics: The scientific study of sounds waves,
The characteristics of a room, auditorium that determine how sound is transmitted within it.

Psychoacoustics: The scientific study of sound perception. Branch of science studying the psychological and physiological responses associated with sound (including noise, speech and music)

Audition: The act of hearing, passive or active (listening)

Auditory Scene Analysis: Bregman, model for the basis of auditory perception. This is understood as the process by which the human auditory system organises sound into perceptually meaningful elements
