- The nature of frequency analysis in the basilar membrane



#### Overview

- Acoustic energy, vibrations in a medium, cause a flow of energy which will eventually arrive at our ear where those disturbances are translated into electrical signals. These are sent to the brain where they are then perceived as sound.
- So, the ear itself can be seen as a form of an energy converter: acoustic energy (sound waves) -> mechanical energy -> electrical energy
- The brain interprets the electrical energy as sound



#### Overview

- An understanding of how the ear works is fundamental in understanding how we perceive our sonic environment and thus how we engage with the sounds around us
- Knowledge of how the ear works can also be used to enhance recording techniques, music composition, general auditory research, the study and prevention of hearing defects



#### Overview

- In our study of the ear and psychoacoustics in general, we will look at how the ear converts vibrations in the environment into an electrical signals, how we locate the direction of a sound, various psychoacoustic phenomena, hearing damage, recording and production considerations, pitch perception and how we perceive consonance and dissonance.



#### The Phenomenon of Hearing

- In some aspects, the ear can be considered to work in a similar manner to a microphone:
- 1) The diaphragm on a microphone likened to the eardrum in our middle ear 
- 2) The manner in which a microphone/ the inner ear system converts the original vibrations in the air around the microphone/ ear into electrical signals are very similar

- 8) Basilar membrane, 9) Round window,  10) Eustacian Tube



#### Outer ear: Physiology
- The outer ear consists of the pinna, auditory canal and tympanic membrane 
- The depression at the entry to the auditory canal is known as the 'concha'
- The auditory canal is approximately 25 to 35mm's long from the concha to the tympanic membrane/eardrum.
- The tympanic membrane is a light, thin, highly elastic structure which forms the boundary between the outer ear and inner ears.



#### Outer ear: Physiology

- It consists of three layers.
    - The outside layer which is a continuation of the skin lining in the auditory canal - The inside layer which is continuous with the mucous linings of the middle ear.
    - The layer between these which is a fibrous structure which gives the tympanic membrane its elasticity and strength



#### Outer ear: Functions

- 'Funnels' Sound
- Sound localisation, particularly front/back resolution (also above/below to a lesser extent). Direction dependent filtering of the pinna.
- The outer ear also modifies the frequency response of incoming signals



#### Outer ear: Functions
- Enhancement of certain frequencies: resonance effects, primarily of the auditory canal: main resonance 3-4Khz (direction independent). Therefore the frequencies around this area of the spectrum are enhanced.
- The concha also acts as an acoustic resonant cavity.

- The tympanic membrane converts acoustic pressure variations into mechanical vibrations to the middle ear: a transduction.



#### Outer ear: Functions

#### Middle ear: 

- Basically, a variety of small suspension ligaments and muscles connecting the ossicles to surrounding structures in an air filled cavity
- The three ossicles (3 small bones) 
    1. Malleus(hammer)
    2. Incus(anvil)
    3. Stapes(stirrup)



#### Middle ear: Physiology

- The malleus is fixed to the eardrum. It pulls it inwards when it is at rest, thus the eardrum appears concave. 
- The stapes footplate, is attached to the oval window of the conchlea.



#### Middle ear: Physiology
- The incus receives vibrations from the malleus, to which it is connected laterally, and transmits these to the stapes.
- Acoustic vibrations are transmitted via the tympanic membrane and ossicles as mechanical movements to the cochlea of the inner ear.



#### Middle ear: Functions

- The middle ear transmits the movements of the eardrum to the fluid which fills the cochlea (perilymph)
- It also acts as a protective system against high sound levels which could damage the delicate inner ear mechanism.
- The three ossicles work together to form an impedance transformer. This is necessary as the fluid in the inner ear is more resistant to movement than air.



#### Middle ear: Functions
- The pressure at the stapes footplate is significantly larger than that at the tympanic membrane. Thus efficient transfer from the tympanic membrane to the oval window is achieved.
- The middle ear achieves this via the..:
    1. Levering effect of the malleus and incus.
    2. Concentration of force onto the oval window surface area (1/15th that of the eardrum)

#### The Middle Ear: Lever Effect
- We can clearly see the difference in length between the malleus and the incus leading to the 'lever' effect in the previous diagram.
- We can see also that the tympanic membrane and the stapes footplate are different in area size. Both factors will lead to a change in acoustic impedance.



#### The Middle Ear: Lever Effect

- The force at the stapes footplate relates to the force at the tympanic membrane by the ratio lengths of the malleus and the incus as follows:
$ F1 \times L1 = F2 \times L2 $

F1, F2 forces at the two points (tympanic membrane, stapes footplate) L1, L2 lengths of the two ossicles (malleus, incus)
Therefore:
 
$F2 = F1 \times (L1/L2) $



#### The Middle Ear: Lever Effect

- A secondary effect, the buckling of the tympanic membrane, provides an extra force increase by a factor of 2.
- This effect the force applied to the malleus.
- The malleus is approximately 1.3 times the length of the incus.



#### The Middle Ear: Lever Effect

- The area of the tympanic membrane is approximately 13 times that of the stapes footplate.
- Considering the above, the pressure at the stapes footplate is thus about $(13 \times 1.3 \times 2 = 33.8)$ times more than the pressure at the tympanic membrane.
- This increases the waveform pressure by around $30.6 dB$



#### Acoustic Reflex

- The acoustic reflex protects the sensitive inner ear from large pressure variation.
- Two muscles are responsible - the tympanic and stapedius muscles. These tighten when subjected to loud sounds.
- The effect takes 60 to 120 ms to come into action. Hence it is of little use in the case of explosive sounds (e.g. gunshots). Also the muscles cannot maintain their taut mode of existence indefinitely. 



#### Acoustic Reflex
- Therefore exposure to prolonged loud sounds will cause inner ear damage. 
- Another function of these muscles is to dampen down the sound of ones own voice. As we speak, these little muscles adjust the middle ear bone tension.
- Above 75 dB SPL, the acoustic reflex begins to work, stiffening of the ossicular chain reduces the effeciency of the energy transmission, thus lowering the levels sent to the inner ear.
- Approximately 12 to 14 dB of attentuation is provided by this mechanism, but for frequencies below 1kHz only



#### Inner Ear

#### Inner Ear
<img src="./images/cochlea.jpg" width="650px" height="500px"></img>



#### Inner Ear

- The chochlea receives vibrations from the middle ear at the 'base', terminates at the 'apex'. Coiled into a spiral, approx. 2.75 turns.
- The function of the chochlea is to detect sounds at different frequencies and transform this information into electric signals which are sent to the brain for processing.



#### Inner Ear

- The structure of the chochlea includes:
    - Oval Window: Where the stapes connects to the cochlea
    - Round Window: membrane moves in compensation for the movement of the oval window (since the fluid inside of the inner ear (perilymph) is incompressible)
    - Basilar membrane: a 'spectrum analyser' which is connected to the nerve cells, transforming the signal into electrical impulses



#### Inner Ear

<img src="./images/vestibular.jpg" width="650px" height="500px"></img>



#### Inner Ear

- The vestibular membrane (Reissner's membrane) and the basilar membrane divide the chochlea into 3 sections
- The scala vestibuli, and the scala tympani contain perilymp: an incompressible fluid. The inner channel is called the scala media.



#### Inner Ear
- The scala vestibuli terminates at the oval window and the scala tympani at the round window
- Sound, having travelled through the outer and middle ear causes movement of the stapes at the oval window. Waves propagate in the scala vestibuli, displacing the basilar membrane and vestibular membrane. As the oval window moves inward, the round window moves outward as the perilymph is incompressible.



#### Basilar Membrane

- On the basilar membrane, the organ of corti contains hair cells, the movement of which leads to the firing of neurons.
- The basilar membrane is a band of muscle which responds to different frequencies along the length.
- At the other end, the apex, it is thick and wide and responds to low frequencies. 



#### Frequency Analysis
- Different places of the Basilar membrane will be displaced by sinusoids at different frequencies
- Complex tones will cause the membrane to react to each component frequency
- The Organ of Corti transmits basilar membrane displacements to the brain.
- Organ of Corti: A number of hair cells (distributes along the basilar membrane), which, when bent (by basilar membrane displacement due to input sound at appropriate frequency) trigger nerve firings.
- The auditory nerve: bundle of nerves from these hair cells



#### Summary

- Inner Ear:
    - Physiology: cochlea: basilar membrane – Function: Logarithmic frequency analysis
- Middle Ear: The three ossicles
    - Physiology: Malleus (hammer), Incus (anvil) and Stapes (stirrup)
    - Functions: Smallest ear-drum pressure-> Ossicles (lever-system)->larger oval window pressure: change Impedance.. also Acoustic Reflex




#### Summary

- Outer Ear
    - Physiology: Pinna, auditory canal and tympanic membrane - Functions: Localisation and resonance




#### Summary
- Note - the response to frequencies in the basilar membrane is logarithmic. Equal linear distances along it correspond to equal frequency ratios.
- A particular musical interval (a frequency ratio) corresponds to a certain constant linear distance between two points along the basilar membrane.



#### Summary
- This is the reason behind the fact that we perceive frequencies logarithmically rather than linearly.
- e.g. A note frequencies: 55Hz, 110Hz, 220Hz, 440Hz, 880Hz, 1760Hz -  We perceive a double in frequency as an octave in difference



#### Summary
- So the sensitivity of the ear is based on a purely mechanical vibrating system. The minimum movement detectable by this system is of the order of the width of a hydrogen atom. For this to be the case, the vibrating surfaces of the inner ear must be extremely light. So that they are also robust, they are encased in the hardest bone in the body - the petrous temporal bone which encompasses the vestibular system and the cochlea.
