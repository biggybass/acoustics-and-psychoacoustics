### Notes, Harmony and Pitch Perception I



#### Musical Notes

- Music of all cultures is based on the use of instruments (including the human voice) which produce notes of different pitches 
- The particular set of pitches used by any culture may be unique but the psychoacoustic basis on which pitch is perceived is basic to all human listeners



#### Musical Notes and Fundamental Frequency

- When we listen to a note played on a musical instrument and we perceive it as having a clear unambiguous musical pitch
- this is because that instrument produces an acoustic pressure wave which repeats regularly



#### Musical Notes and Fundamental Frequency

- Acoustic pressure waveform of A4 (440Hz) played on a violin, trumpet, flute and oboe



#### Musical Notes and Fundamental Frequency

- We can see that the waveshape repeats regularly, or the waveform is 'periodic'
- Each section that repeats is known as a 'cycle' and the time for which each cycle lasts is known as the 'fundamental period' or 'period' of the waveform.



#### Musical Notes and Fundamental Frequency

- The number of cycles which occur in one second gives the fundamental frequency of the note in hertz (or Hz)
- The fundamental frequency is often notated as $f_0$



#### Musical Notes and Fundamental Frequency

- Thus $f_0$ of any waveform can be found from its period as:

$f_0 \text{in Hz}=\frac{1}{\text{period in seconds}}$

- and the period from a known $f_0$ as:

$ \text{period in seconds}=\frac{1}{f_0 \text{in Hz}}$



#### Musical Notes and Fundamental Frequency

<img src='./images/pitch/img.png' width='280px' height='240px'></img>

- For the violin note shown the $f_0$ equivalent to any cycle can be found by measuring the period of that cycle from the waveform plot from which the $f\_0$ can be calculated 



#### Musical Notes and Fundamental Frequency

- The period is measured from any point in one cycle to the point in the next (or last) cycle where it repeats, for example a positive peak, a negative peak or a point where it crosses the zero amplitude line
- The distance marked 'T' for the violin in the figure shows where the period could be measured between negative peaks



#### Musical Notes and Fundamental Frequency

- If we measured the period of this waveform to be 2.27 ms we can work out the frequency in Hz

- $f_0 = \frac{1}{2.27ms} = \frac{1}{(2.27 \times 10^{-3})s} = 440.5\text{Hz}$



#### Musical Notes and Fundamental Frequency
- This is close to 440Hz, which is the tuning reference $f_0$ for A4 
- Variation in tuning accuracy, intonation or, for example, vibrato if the note were not played on an open string, will mean that the $f\_0$ measured for any particular individual cycle is not likely to be exactly equivalent to a reference $f_0$ value



#### Musical notes and their harmonics

<img src='./images/pitch/img.png' width='280px' height='240px'></img>
- While the periods and therefore the $f_0$ values of these notes are similar, their waveform shapes are very different



#### Musical notes and their harmonics
- The perceived pitch of each of these notes will be A4
- But different harmonic components in each waveform will give each instrument its distinctive timbre



#### Musical notes and their harmonics
- Every instrument therefore has an underlying set of partials in its spectrum
- The frequency components of notes produced by any pitched instrument such as a violin, oboe, clarinet, trumpet, etc., are harmonics, or integer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc.) multiples of $f_0$



#### Musical notes and their harmonics

- Thus the only possible frequency components for the acoustic pressure waveform of the violin note whose $f_0$ is 440.5 Hz are: 440.5 Hz ($1 \times $440.5 Hz); 881.0Hz ($2 \times$ 440.5Hz); 1321.5Hz ($3 \times $440.5Hz); 1762Hz ($4 \times $440.5Hz); 2202.5 Hz ($5 \times $440.5 Hz);



#### Musical notes and their harmonics

- An earlier term still used for referring to the components of a periodic waveform is 'overtones'
- The first overtone refers to the first frequency component that is 'over' or above $f_0$, the second overtone is the third harmonic, and so on.



#### Musical notes and their harmonics

- There is no theoretical upper limit to the number of harmonics which could be present in the output from any particular instrument, although for many instruments there are acoustic limits imposed by the structure of the instrument itself
- Perhaps an upper limit can be set though, in terms of the number of harmonics which could be present based on the upper frequency limit of the hearing system, for which a practical limit might be 16 000Hz



#### Musical notes and their harmonics

- An instrument playing the A above middle C, which has an $f_0$ of 440Hz, could theoretically contain 36 (16,000/440) harmonics within the human hearing 
- Playing an octave higher the output could now theoretically contain 18 (16,000/880) harmonics



#### Musical intervals between harmonics
- As we have discussed a note perceived to have a distinct pitch contains frequency components that are integer multiples of $f_0$ usually known as 'harmonics'
- Each one of these harmonic components being sine wave
- Analysing the musical relationship between individual harmonics is instructive in trying to understand the development of Western musical harmony



#### Musical intervals between harmonics

- The musical intervals of adjacent harmonics in the natural harmonic series starting with the fundamental or first harmonic, are: octave (2:1), perfect fifth (3:2), perfect fourth (4:3), major third (5:4), minor third (6:5), flat minor third (7:6), sharp major second (8:7), a major whole tone (9:8), and a minor whole tone (10:9)



#### Musical intervals between harmonics

- Ratios for other commonly used musical intervals can be inferred from this series, 
- The frequency ratio for a perfect fourth (4:3) can be found from that for a perfect fifth (3:2) since together they make one octave (2:1)
- C to G (perfect fifth) and G to C (perfect fourth)



#### Musical intervals between harmonics

- The perfect fifth has a frequency ratio 3:2 and the octave a ratio of 2:1.
- Bearing in mind that musical intervals are ratios in terms of their frequency relationships we can use division and multiplication to calculate any required interval

Frequency ratio for a perfect 4th $=\frac{2}{1}\div\frac{3}{2}=\frac{2}{1}\times\frac{2}{3}=\frac{4}{3}$



#### Musical intervals between harmonics

- Two other common intervals are the major sixth and minor sixth, and their frequency ratios can be found from those for the minor third and major third respectively since in each case they combine to make one octave.



#### Musical intervals between harmonics

- Octave (2:1), a minor third (6:5), therefore major sixth = octave / minor third

$=\frac{2}{1}\div\frac{6}{5}=\frac{2}{1}\times\frac{5}{6}=\frac{5}{3}$




#### Musical intervals between harmonics

- Octave (2:1), a major third (5:4), therefore minor sixth = octave / major third

$=\frac{2}{1}\div\frac{5}{4}=\frac{2}{1}\times\frac{4}{5}=\frac{8}{5}$



#### Hearing Pitch

- The perception of pitch is basic to the hearing of tonal music
- Familiarity with current theories of pitch perception as well as other aspects of psychoacoustics enables a well founded understanding of musically important matters such as tuning, intonation, perfect pitch, vibrato, electronic synthesis of new sounds, and pitch paradoxes



#### Hearing Pitch

- Pitch relates to the perceived position of a sound on a scale from low to high
- "pitch is that attribute of auditory sensation in terms of which sounds may be ordered on a scale extending from low to high." - American National Standards Institute
- The measurement of pitch is therefore subjective because it requires a human listener to make a perceptual judgement.



#### Hearing Pitch

- Sounds which have a periodic acoustic pressure variation with time are perceived as having a pitch associated with them
- Sounds whose acoustic pressure waveform is non-periodic are perceived as having no pitch



#### Hearing Pitch

- The pitch of a note varies as its $f\_0$ is changed: the greater the $f_0$ the higher the pitch and vice versa
- Although the measurement of pitch and $f\_0$ are subjective and objective and measured on a scale of high/low and Hz respectively, a measurement of pitch can be given in Hz



#### Hearing Pitch

- This is achieved by asking a listener to compare the sound of interest by switching between it and a sine wave with a variable frequency. 
- The listener would adjust the frequency of the sine wave until the pitches of the two sounds are perceived as being equal, at which point the pitch of the sound of interest is equal to the frequency of the sine wave in Hz.



#### Hearing Pitch

- Two basic theories of pitch perception have been proposed to explain how the human hearing system is able to locate and track changes in the $f_0$ of an input sound
    - The place theory and,
    - The temporal theory



#### Place theory of pitch perception

- The place theory of pitch perception relates directly to the frequency analysis carried out by the basilar membrane in which different frequency components of the input sound stimulate different positions, or places, on the membrane
- Neural firing of the hair cells occurs at each of these places, indicating to higher centers of neural processing and the brain which frequency components are present in the input sound



#### Place theory of pitch perception

- There are a number of methods to find the value of $f_0$ based on a place analysis of the components of an input sound
- This allows for the possibility of some 'higher processing' of the component frequencies at higher centers of neural processing and / or the brain



#### Place theory of pitch perception

- Method 1: Locate the $f_0$ component itself.
- Method 2: Find the minimum frequency difference between adjacent harmonics. The frequency difference between the (n + 1)th and the (n)th harmonic, which are adjacent by definition if all harmonics are present, is:

$((n+1)f_0)-(nf\_0)=(nf\_0)+(1f\_0)-(nf\_0)=f\_0$



#### Place theory of pitch perception

- Method 3: Find the highest common factor (the highest number that will divide into all the frequencies present giving an integer result) of the components present



#### Place theory of pitch perception

- One of the earliest versions of the place theory suggests that the pitch of a sound corresponds to the place stimulated by the lowest frequency component in the sound which is $f_0$ as in Method 1
- The assumption underlying this is that f0 is always present in sounds and the theory was encapsulated by Ohm in his second or 'acoustical' law



#### Place theory of pitch perception

- 'a pitch corresponding to a certain frequency can only be heard if the acoustic wave contains power at that frequency'



#### Place theory of pitch perception

- Schouten (1940) demonstrated that the pitch of a pulse wave remained the same when the fundamental component was removed, thus demonstrating: 
    - (i) that $f_0$ did not have to be present for pitch perception, and 
    - (ii) that the lowest component present is not the basis for pitch perception because the pitch does not jump up by one octave



#### Place theory of pitch perception

- This experiment has become known as 'the phenomenon of the missing fundamental' and suggests that Method 1 cannot account for human pitch perception.



#### Place theory of pitch perception

- Method 2 seems to provide an attractive possibility since the place theory gives the positions of the harmonics, whether or not $f_0$ is present 
- It should provide a basis for pitch perception provided some adjacent harmonics are present, and for most musical sounds they are



#### Place theory of pitch perception

<img src='./images/pitch/img 1.png' width='400px' height='200px'></img>
- Above shows an idealized spectrum of a sound which contains just odd harmonics (1 $f\_0$, 3 $f\_0$, 5 $f\_0$, ...)



#### Place theory of pitch perception

<img src='./images/pitch/img 1.png' width='400px' height='200px'></img>
- It also shows that measurement of the frequency distance between adjacent harmonics would give $f_0$, $2 f\_0$, $2 f\_0$, $2 f\_0$, etc.




#### Place theory of pitch perception

<img src='./images/pitch/img 1.png' width='400px' height='200px'></img>
- The minimum spacing between the harmonics is $f_0$, which gives a possible basis for pitch perception.



#### Place theory of pitch perception

<img src='./images/pitch/img 1.png' width='400px' height='200px'></img>
- However, if the $f_0$ component were removed the perceived pitch would not change
- The spacings between adjacent harmonics is now $3 f_0$, $2 f\_0$, $2 f\_0$, $2 f\_0$, etc. the minimum spacing is $2 f\_0$, but the pitch does not jump up by an octave



#### Place theory of pitch perception
- Method 3: Find the highest common factor, will give an appropriate $f_0$ for: 
    - (i) sounds with missing $f\_0$ components 
    - (ii) sounds with odd harmonic components only, and 
    - (iii) sounds with odd harmonic components only with a missing $f\_0$ component



#### Place theory of pitch perception
- In each case, the highest common factor of the components is $f_0$
- This method also provides a basis for understanding how a pitch is perceived for non-harmonic sounds, such as bells or chime bars, whose components are not exact harmonics (integer multipliers) of the resulting $f_0$



#### Place theory of pitch perception

- As an example of such a non-harmonic sound, Schouten in one of his later experiments produced sounds whose component frequencies were 1040Hz, 1240Hz, and 1440Hz and found that the perceived pitch was approximately 207 Hz
- The $f\_0$ for these components, based on the minimum spacing between the components (Method 2), is 200 Hz



#### Place theory of pitch perception

- Using Method 3, and taking 1040, 1240 and 1440 to be the 5th, 6th and 7th harmonic gives a lowest common factor of 208, 207 and 206 Hz respectively
- The average of these values is 207Hz, and Schouten referred to the pitch perceived in such a situation as the 'residue pitch' or 'pitch of the residue.' It is also sometimes referred to as 'virtual pitch.'



#### Problems with the place theory
- The place theory provides a basis for understanding how $f_0$ could be found from a frequency analysis of components. 
- However, there are a number of problems with the place theory because it does not explain:



#### Problems with the place theory

1. The fine degree of accuracy observed in human pitch perception
2. Pitch perception of sounds whose frequency components are not
    resolved by the place mechanism;
3. The pitch perceived for some sounds which have continuous (non- harmonic) spectra; or
4. Pitch perception for sounds with an $f\_0$ less than 50 Hz.



#### Problems with the place theory

- Psychoacoustically, the ability to discriminate between sounds that are nearly the same except for a change in one aspect ($f_0$, intensity, duration, etc.) is measured as the 'just noticeable difference' JND.
- The JND for pitch is approximately one thirtieth of the critical bandwidth across the hearing range
- This is equivalent to approximately one twelfth of a semitone
- Thus the JND in pitch is much smaller than the resolution of the analysis filters (critical bandwidth)



#### Problems with the place theory

- The place mechanism will resolve a given harmonic of an input sound provided that the critical bandwidth of the filter concerned is sufficiently narrow to exclude adjacent harmonics
- It turns out that, no matter what the $f_0$ of the sound is, only the first five to seven harmonics are resolved by the place analysis mechanism.



#### Problems with the place theory

- Consider a sound consisting of all harmonics ($f\_0$ , 2 $f\_0$ , 3 $f\_0$, 4 $f\_0$, 5 $f\_0$, etc.) whose $f\_0$ is 110Hz

<img src='./images/pitch/img 2.png' width='600px' height='400px'></img>



#### Problems with the place theory

- The frequencies of the first 10 harmonics are given in the left-hand column of the table

<img src='./images/pitch/img 2.png' width='600px' height='400px'></img>



#### Problems with the place theory

- The next column shows the critical bandwidth of a filter centered on each of these harmonics

<img src='./images/pitch/img 2.png' width='600px' height='400px'></img>



#### Problems with the place theory

- The critical bandwidth increases with filter center frequency and the frequency analysis action of the basilar membrane is equivalent to a bank of filters.

<img src='./images/pitch/img 2.png' width='600px' height='400px'></img>



#### Problems with the place theory

- Harmonics will cease to be resolved by the place mechanism when the critical bandwidth exceeds the frequency spacing between adjacent harmonics, which is $f_0$ when all adjacent harmonics are present.

<img src='./images/pitch/img 2.png' width='500px' height='360px'></img>



#### Problems with the place theory

- In the table, it can be seen that the critical bandwidth is greater than f0 for the filter centred at 770Hz (the seventh harmonic), but this filter will resolve the seventh harmonic since it is centred over it and its bandwidth extends half above and half below 770Hz



#### Problems with the place theory
- However, the filter centred between the seventh and eighth harmonics has a critical bandwidth of 113.7 Hz which exceeds $f_0$ 110Hz

<img src='./images/pitch/img 2.png' width='500px' height='360px'></img>



#### Problems with the place theory

- The seventh and eighth harmonics will not be resolved by this filter
- Due to the continuous nature of the wave travelling along the basilar membrane no harmonics will be resolved in this example above the sixth since there will be areas on the membrane responding to at-least adjacent pairs of harmonics everywhere above the place where the sixth harmonic stimulates it.



#### Problems with the place theory

- We can confirm this using the ERB (Equivalent Rectangular bandwidth) scale.
- Find the center frequency for which the critical bandwidth equals $f_0$ 110Hz

$f\_{c}(kHz) = \Big[ \frac{\big( \frac{ERB}{24.7} \big) - 1}{4.37}  \Big]$



#### Problems with the place theory

$f\_{c}(kHz) = \Big[ \frac{\big( \frac{110}{24.7} \big) - 1}{4.37}  \Big] = \Big[ \frac{4.453 - 1}{4.37} \Big]$

$= \Big[ \frac{3.453}{4.37} \Big] = 0.79kHz, 790Hz$



#### Problems with the place theory

- The center frequency of the filter whose critical bandwidth is 110.0 Hz is 790 Hz
- All filters above 790 Hz will have bandwidths that are greater than its bandwidth of 110 Hz, because we know that the critical bandwidth increases with center frequency
- As it lies below the center frequency of the filter midway between the seventh (770Hz) and eighth (880 Hz) harmonics, those harmonics will not be resolved



#### Problems with the place theory
- There are sounds which have non-harmonic spectra for which a pitch is perceived
- These are exceptions to the second part of the general statement given that 'sounds whose acoustic pressure waveform is non-periodic are perceived as having no pitch.'



#### Problems with the place theory

- In speech for example, in the words 'sea' & 'shell', most listeners will readily respond that the 'ss' in sea has a higher pitch than 'sh.' in shell



#### Problems with the place theory

<img src='./images/pitch/img 3.png' width='450px' height='500px'></img>



#### Problems with the place theory

<img src='./images/pitch/img 4.png' width='450px' height='250px'></img>

- Notice that the energy is biased more towards lower frequencies for the 'sh' with a peak around 2.5kHz, compared with the 'ss' where the energy has a peak at about 5kHz



#### Problems with the place theory

- The 'center of gravity' of the spectral energy of a sound is thought to convey a sense of higher or lower pitch for such sounds which are noise based, but the pitch sensation is far weaker than for that perceived for periodic sounds
- This is important in music when considering the perception of the non-periodic sounds of, for example, the percussion section of an ensemble, although most instruments produce periodic acoustic pressure variations



#### Problems with the place theory

- The final identified problem is that the pitch perceived for sounds with components only below 50Hz cannot be explained by the place theory
- The pattern of vibration on the basilar membrane does not appear to change in that region



#### Problems with the place theory

- Since the typical lowest audible frequency for humans is 20 Hz, a sound with an $f_0$ of 20 Hz would have harmonics at 40Hz, 60Hz, etc. and only the first two fall within this region where no change is observed in basilar membrane response
- Harmonics above 50Hz will be analysed by the place mechanism in the usual manner. Sinusoids in the 20-50Hz range are perceived as having different pitches and the place mechanism cannot explain this.
