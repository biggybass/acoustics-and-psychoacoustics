## Acoustics and Psychoacoustics (MU610A): Continuous Assessment Presentation 

Either individually or in groups of no more than three, you must prepare and give a presentation based on the Acoustics & Psychoacoustics material covered in this class.

Some areas of consideration when formulating the topic could be:
- Considering acoustics and psychoacoustics in music composition
- The use or misuse of acoustics and/or psychoacoustics research in modern day recording techniques
- Acoustic properties of musical instruments

The primary area of focus here is to show that you can apply the material that is being covered in the class to a wider area such as in your career, general practice, further studies, etc.
